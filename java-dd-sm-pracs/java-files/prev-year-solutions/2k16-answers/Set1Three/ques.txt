/*
 * Create a package called Centigrade which will have a class to initialize and
 * display temperature in the centigrade scale. Similarly, create another
 * package called Farenheit which will have a class to initialize and display
 * temperature in the farenheit scale. Both of these packages are to be created
 * in the same path. Now create another class named as Compare in the parent
 * directory of the previously created packages and it will be used to compare
 * the temperature values stored in the previously defined classes and to
 * display suitable messages.
